# U2.W4: Numbers to Commas Solo Challenge

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and 
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.  


# 1. Pseudocode

# What is the input?

Input is a random number

# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)

Output is a string with commas separating every three integer places

If random number < 1,000 then returns random number
If random number >=1,000 then returns string inserting a comma every three places


# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?

1. If random number < 1,000 then return random number
2. If random number >=1,000 then returns string
3. Insert a comma after last 0*4+3 places of the string
4. Insert a comma after the last 1*4+3 plages of the string if it exists
	It not return string as is
5. Insert a comma after the last 2*4+3 places of the string
	If not return string as is
6. Loop this until loop breaks
